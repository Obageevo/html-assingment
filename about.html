    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I never studied Computer Science. I have a BSc in Human Kinetics and a masters degree in Sport Psychology. I'm a lover of nature and music.
        <br> During my leisure, I listen to music, play basketball, write music and occasionally hangout with friends. I love Sci- movies, Cartoons and horror movies.
        <br> I am kind of a shy person, but i'm pretty confident. I enjoy coding more than I thought I would and I feel it's because I enjoy arranging, building and fixing things.
        <p>I also make music of my own. Check it out on Audiomack <a href="https://audiomack.com/Obageevo" target="_blank">Click here</a></p>
